# Module 06 - Extend your tool functionality with patterns

In the last three modules, we have discussed agent tools. This module continues this exploration by describing several common tool patterns:
- Mocking tool output
- Adding multiple actions per tool
- Transforming tool output
- Implementing complex control flow in tools via nested workflows
- Implementing Human-in-the-loop / approval patterns
- Understanding parallel tool execution
