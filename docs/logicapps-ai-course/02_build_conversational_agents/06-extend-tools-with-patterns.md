# Module 06 - Extend your tool functionality with patterns

Throughout the last three modules, we introduced agent tools. This module continues this exploration through several common tool patterns:
- Mocking tool output
- Adding multiple actions per tool
- Transforming tool output
- Complex control flow in tools via nested workflows
- Human-in-the-loop
- Parallel tool execution
